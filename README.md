Portfolio

My online portfolio contains result of my work from several month studies. 
In the first section you can find a link to my resume and navigate through the site.
The button "Hire me" in the first section leads to the last section where you can send me a message.
The second section contains information about me as well as my contact information, including link to my Linkedin profile.
Links to my projects, hosted on GitHub pages, you can find in the third section.
If you fill the send-me-message form in fourth section and submit it, that will open your mail agent (e.g. Microsoft Outlook) on your PC. Make sure it is installed if nothing happens.
